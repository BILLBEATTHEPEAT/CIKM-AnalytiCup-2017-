This is a deep learning model of convLSTM structure implemented with Keras.

However, because of the insufficient tuning (due to the lack of time and computing resource, especially GPU resource), this model did not get a good score during the competition. The best RMSE is 14.18 (ranked nearly 60 of 1395).
Though the result is not good enough, according to the original paper of this convolutional LSTM networok of [Xingjian Shi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214)
I still believe this model has a great potential of dealing with this kind of problems. So I put this model here as a reference.
